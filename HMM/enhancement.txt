Laplace smoothing adds a small constant value to all counts in the table, effectively smoothing out the probabilities and preventing them from being zero. The formula is:

p_new(i,j) = (count(i,j) + alpha / (count(i) + num_states)

where count(i,j) : transition or emission counts from state i to state j or emission of word j at state i.

In the HMM implementation provided, we can apply Laplace smoothing by adding 1 to all the counts in the probability tables before computing the probabilities. 
In the code: 

In the modified fit method:
-    add alpha to the counts in the transition and emission probability tables before computing the probabilities. 
-    add _sizeStateSpace and DataLoader.numWords, respectively, to the denominators of the transition and emission probabilities (that's to account for the additional count from the smoothing)

alpha in this code is 0.87
